# Lift Log
A nostalgia driven project. A classic Pokedex with all of the original 151 Pokemon.

## How It's Made:
React, HTML/CSS/JS

The front end is built with React. It makes requests to a RESTful API for data on Pokemon.

## Optimizations
An optimization that can be made would be to implement pagination or loading entries only when scrolled to. Worth considering if I expand the Pokedex to include more generations.

## Lessons Learned:
One of my earlier attempts at a larger React project. It helped me become more comfortable building front end projects that make frequent requests to an API.
