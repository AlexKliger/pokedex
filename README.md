# Pokedex
A personal project with nostalgia as a powerful motivator. A recreation of the Generation I Pokedex from the original game. It contains entries for the original 151 Pokemon.

## How It's Made:
React, HTML/CSS/JS

The frontend is built using React.js. Requests are made to a third-party RESTful API for data on Pokemon. Credit: https://pokeapi.co/

## Optimizations
If I plan to expand the Pokedex to include later generations, loading entries only when being scrolled to would help when requested data gets too large.

## Lessons Learned:
One of my earlier attempts at a larger React project. It helped me become more comfortable building frontend projects that consume third-party RESTful APIs.
